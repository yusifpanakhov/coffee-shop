CoffeeShop demo (React + Vite + Tailwind)
======================================

How to use:
1. Extract the zip and open the folder in VS Code.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server.
4. Open http://localhost:5173

Credentials (mock, client-side only):
- Admin: admin / admin123
- User: user / user123

Notes:
- This is a simple client-side demo with mock authentication.
- To make real auth you should add a backend or implement a secure auth provider.
